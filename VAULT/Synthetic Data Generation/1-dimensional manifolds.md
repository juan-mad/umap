Ideas for generating 1-dimensional manifolds, or data varying in one dimension, inside a higher dimension space

- Curves inside $\mathbb R^n$ 
	- Closed or open
	- Interesting if it does not translate to a lower dimension just by projecting onto a plane (e.g. twisted eight)
- Curves inside a torus/sphere
	- Same would apply
- 1-dimensional gaussian distributions

### Noise
- Every generated point along the curve is displaced by Gaussian noise in $\mathbb R^n$
- Add uniform noise over the space where the curve is
