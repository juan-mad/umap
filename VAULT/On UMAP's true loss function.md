When comparing UMAPs behaviour when embedding in a space with the same dimension, the experiments with a uniformly distributed sample inside a ring show that, in the embedding, show that the embedded points appear in a contracted ring. This goes against Narayan's (densMAP author) that this only occurs in low density areas and that it is due to the normalisation imposed through $\sigma_i$. According to the authors, this cannot be exactly the case for this dataset, since *we know they are uniformly distributed*.

**Question**: how does UMAP consider the Riemannian metric in the original space? If it is approximated as explained in the paper, is it the Euclidean distance inherited from $\mathbb R^2$ or is it a different one?
**How to answer this**: Read the code provided by the authors and UMAP's and see if they match / what distance do they consider. If it is a different one, check how this new metric is and if it may explain this behaviour.
